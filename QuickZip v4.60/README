This is my version of the QuickZip 4.60 exploit

Inspired by https://blog.knapsy.com/blog/2017/05/01/quickzip-4-dot-60-win7-x64-seh-overflow-egghunter-with-custom-encoder/

I've built this exploit as an exercise to demonstrate bad characters can be useful sometimes :)

However, I highly recommend checking the write up above from @TheKnapsy. He went through an even harder (and funner) path.
